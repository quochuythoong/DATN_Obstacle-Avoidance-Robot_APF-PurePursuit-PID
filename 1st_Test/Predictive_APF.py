# '''
# Overview of Predictive APF (PAPF):
# - PAPF will choose a temporary_goal (a point from the basic APF that has the greatest deviation from the start-goal line)
# - Go to that temporary_goal & set it as a new_start (creating a new_start-goal line)
# - Loop it until reaching the original Goal
# - Returning a smoother and more straightforward path planning

# Skeleton of the PAPF:
# def path_planning(...):
#     return path

# def predictive_path(original_path)
#     original_path = path_planning() # Original path (for example): [(2.5,6) (3,5.7) 4,5.5  5,4 6,3 7,3.5 8,4 9,4.5 10,4.8 11,5 12,4.5 13,4.2]
#     start = original_path[1]
#     goal = original_path[-1]
#     find greatest_deviation from start-goal # start-goal is a straight line from start to goal
#     plan path from start[2.5,6] to greatest_deviation from start-goal # in this case the greatest_deviation[6,3]
#         set the latest greatest_deviattion as a temporary_goal, 
#     after reaching the 1st temporary_goal
#         set it as a new_start
#     find next_greatest_deviation from new_start-goal # in this case, the next greatest_deviation is [11,5]
#         set the latest greatest deviation as a temporary_goal
#     after reaching the 1st temporary_goal
#         set it as a new_start
#     loop it until it reach the set original Goal [13,4.2]
