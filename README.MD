Below is a comprehensive guide broken down into three main sections:

---

## **1. Overall Structure of the Project**

### **Project Overview**

Your autonomous car project consists of several interlocking modules:

- **Sensing & Perception:**  
  - **Camera (Bird’s-Eye View):** Captures a real-time image of the environment.
  - **ArUco Marker Detection:** Locates the car’s position.
  - **Obstacle Detection:** Uses computer vision (and possibly C++ for performance) to detect obstacles.

- **Path Planning:**  
  - **Global Planner (Dijkstra’s Algorithm):** Calculates an optimal path from the car’s start position to the destination, avoiding obstacles.
  - **Local Refinement (Artificial Potential Field, APF):** Adds local adjustments to “push” the path away from obstacles and smooth out turns.

- **Path Following:**  
  - **Pure Pursuit Controller with Adaptive Lookahead:** Converts the path (a series of waypoints) into steering commands and desired speeds.  
  - **PID for Motor Control:** Uses built-in encoder feedback to adjust PWM signals to the ESP32, ensuring the car runs at the correct speed.

- **Communication:**  
  - **OTA Communication to ESP32:** Sends PWM signals to control the motors in real time.

### **How the Algorithms are Combined**

- **Dijkstra’s Algorithm (DA):**  
  Computes a global path on a cost grid (which is modified by APF) ensuring an optimal route that avoids known obstacles.

- **Artificial Potential Field (APF):**  
  Provides local, dynamic cost adjustments to the grid. It “pushes” the path away from obstacles (repulsive force) while pulling toward the destination (attractive force).  
  → *Combined Approach:* You add the APF “cost” to the base grid used by DA. This way, DA finds a global path that is already “biased” to avoid high-risk areas.

- **Pure Pursuit with Adaptive Lookahead:**  
  Uses the generated waypoints from the DA+APF module. The lookahead distance adapts based on current speed and curvature, ensuring smooth steering commands.

## **2. Step-by-Step Flow (Manual Instructions)**

### **Step 1: Sensing and Perception**
1. **Camera Setup and Calibration:**  
   - Mount a bird’s-eye view camera above the test area.
   - Calibrate the camera (using OpenCV) to remove distortions.
2. **Detect Car and Obstacles:**  
   - Use ArUco markers to find the car’s current position.
   - Implement object detection to identify obstacles in the environment.

### **Step 2: Global Path Planning with DA+APF**
1. **Create a 2D Grid Map:**  
   - Use the camera image to define a grid where each cell represents a cost (base cost for free space).
2. **Compute APF Over the Grid:**  
   - Calculate the attractive potential (based on distance to the destination).
   - Calculate repulsive potential for each detected obstacle.
   - Combine these potentials to adjust the cost of each cell.
3. **Run Dijkstra’s Algorithm:**  
   - Use the adjusted cost grid (base cost + APF) to calculate the optimal path from the start position to the destination.
4. **Extract Waypoints:**  
   - Interpolate the found path into a series of waypoints for the car to follow.

### **Step 3: Path Following with Adaptive Pure Pursuit**
1. **Adaptive Lookahead Calculation:**  
   - Based on the car’s speed and curvature, compute the ideal lookahead distance.
2. **Pure Pursuit Controller:**  
   - Use the lookahead distance to select a target waypoint.
   - Compute the necessary steering angle to reach that waypoint.
3. **PWM and Motor Control:**  
   - Convert the steering and speed commands to PWM signals.
   - Use a PID controller (with encoder feedback) to fine-tune the PWM signals sent to the ESP32.

### **Step 4: Communication and Real-Time Updates**
1. **OTA Communication:**  
   - Send the updated PWM signals from your Python control system to the ESP32.
2. **Real-Time Replanning:**  
   - Continuously monitor for new obstacles.
   - If a new obstacle appears in the current path, trigger a recalculation (go back to Step 2) so that the path is updated in real time.

## **3. Implementation Example**

Below is an illustrative example in Python that outlines key modules. (Note: You would integrate these into your complete system; additional code is needed for camera feed handling and motor control.)

### **A. Global Path Planning (DA + APF)**

```python
import numpy as np
import heapq
import math

    """
    Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path on a 2D grid.
    """
    rows, cols = grid.shape
    costs = np.full((rows, cols), np.inf)
    came_from = np.full((rows, cols, 2), -1, dtype=int)
    costs[start] = 0
    pq = [(0, start)]
    
    while pq:
        current_cost, current = heapq.heappop(pq)
        if current == goal:
            break
        
        # 4-connected neighbors: up, down, left, right
        for dr, dc in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:
            neighbor = (current[0] + dr, current[1] + dc)
            if 0 <= neighbor[0] < rows and 0 <= neighbor[1] < cols:
                new_cost = current_cost + grid[neighbor]
                if new_cost < costs[neighbor]:
                    costs[neighbor] = new_cost
                    came_from[neighbor] = current
                    heapq.heappush(pq, (new_cost, neighbor))
    
    # Reconstruct path if goal is reached
    path = []
    if costs[goal] == np.inf:
        print("No path found!")
        return path
    current = goal
    while current != start:
        path.append(current)
        current = tuple(came_from[current])
    path.append(start)
    path.reverse()
    return path

def compute_apf(grid_shape, goal, obstacles, zeta=1.0, eta=10.0, influence_radius=5):
    """
    Compute an artificial potential field (APF) on a grid.
    """
    rows, cols = grid_shape
    U = np.zeros((rows, cols))
    
    # Attractive potential: quadratic function towards the goal
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            distance = math.hypot(i - goal[0], j - goal[1])
            U[i, j] += 0.5 * zeta * distance ** 2

    # Repulsive potential: significant cost for cells near obstacles
    for obs in obstacles:
        for i in range(rows):
            for j in range(cols):
                d = math.hypot(i - obs[0], j - obs[1])
                if 0 < d <= influence_radius:
                    U[i, j] += 0.5 * eta * ((1.0 / d) - (1.0 / influence_radius)) ** 2
    return U

def hybrid_dijkstra(grid, start, goal, obstacles, zeta=1.0, eta=10.0, influence_radius=5):
    """
    Combines APF with Dijkstra's algorithm for path planning.
    """
    apf_cost = compute_apf(grid.shape, goal, obstacles, zeta, eta, influence_radius)
    combined_cost = grid + apf_cost
    return dijkstra(combined_cost, start, goal)

# Example usage:
grid = np.ones((20, 20))  # Base cost for free space
obstacles = [(10, 10), (10, 11), (11, 10), (11, 11)]  # Detected obstacles (grid indices)
start = (0, 0)
goal = (19, 19)
path = hybrid_dijkstra(grid, start, goal, obstacles)
print("Planned Path:", path)
```

### **B. Pure Pursuit with Adaptive Lookahead**

```python
def compute_lookahead(current_speed, curvature, base_distance=0.5, speed_factor=0.1):
    """
    Compute an adaptive lookahead distance.
    """
    curvature_factor = 1.0 / (1.0 + abs(curvature))
    lookahead_distance = base_distance + speed_factor * current_speed * curvature_factor
    return lookahead_distance

def select_waypoint(path, current_position, lookahead_distance):
    """
    Select the next waypoint along the path at approximately the lookahead distance.
    """
    for waypoint in path:
        dist = math.hypot(waypoint[0] - current_position[0], waypoint[1] - current_position[1])
        if dist >= lookahead_distance:
            return waypoint
    return path[-1]  # Return the final waypoint if none further are found

# Example usage:
current_position = (5, 5)
current_speed = 1.2  # example speed value
# Assume a function that calculates curvature (for demo, we use a constant)
curvature = 0.2  
lookahead = compute_lookahead(current_speed, curvature)
target_waypoint = select_waypoint(path, current_position, lookahead)
print("Target Waypoint:", target_waypoint)
```

### **C. Integration and Control Loop**

Below is a high-level pseudocode outline for the entire system integration:

```python
def main_loop():
    while True:
        # 1. Capture current image from the camera
        image = capture_image()  # implement your camera capture function
        
        # 2. Detect the car's position using ArUco markers
        current_position = detect_aruco(image)
        
        # 3. Detect obstacles in the environment
        obstacles = detect_obstacles(image)
        
        # 4. Global planning: compute new path if needed (e.g., if obstacles changed)
        if path_needs_update(obstacles, current_position):
            path = hybrid_dijkstra(grid, current_position, goal, obstacles)
        
        # 5. Compute adaptive lookahead and select next waypoint
        current_speed = get_current_speed()  # from motor encoders
        curvature = compute_curvature(current_position, path)  # your method for estimating curvature
        lookahead = compute_lookahead(current_speed, curvature)
        target_waypoint = select_waypoint(path, current_position, lookahead)
        
        # 6. Pure Pursuit: compute steering command based on target waypoint
        steering_cmd = pure_pursuit_controller(current_position, target_waypoint)
        
        # 7. PID Control: adjust PWM based on desired steering and speed
        pwm_signal = pid_controller(steering_cmd, current_speed)
        
        # 8. Send PWM command via OTA to the ESP32
        send_pwm_to_esp32(pwm_signal)
        
        # 9. Loop continuously, e.g., sleep for a short interval
        sleep(dt)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main_loop()
```

*Note:* Functions like `capture_image()`, `detect_aruco()`, `detect_obstacles()`, `path_needs_update()`, `compute_curvature()`, `pure_pursuit_controller()`, `pid_controller()`, and `send_pwm_to_esp32()` are placeholders. You’ll need to implement or integrate them based on your hardware and software stack.
