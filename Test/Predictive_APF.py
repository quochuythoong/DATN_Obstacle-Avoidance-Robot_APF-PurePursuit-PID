# PREDICTIVE APF
###############################################################################

'''
Overview of Predictive APF (PAPF):
- PAPF will choose a temporary_goal (a point from the basic APF that has the greatest deviation from the start-goal line)
- Go to that temporary_goal & set it as a new_start (creating a new_start-goal line)
- Loop it until reaching the original Goal
- Returning a smoother and more straightforward path planning

Skeleton of the PAPF:
def path_planning(...):
    return path

def predictive_path(original_path)
    original_path = path_planning() # Original path (for example): [(2.5,6) (3,5.7) 4,5.5  5,4 6,3 7,3.5 8,4 9,4.5 10,4.8 11,5 12,4.5 13,4.2]
    start = original_path[1]
    goal = original_path[-1]
    find greatest_deviation from start-goal # start-goal is a straight line from start to goal
    plan path from start[2.5,6] to greatest_deviation from start-goal # in this case the greatest_deviation[6,3]
        set the latest greatest_deviattion as a temporary_goal, 
    after reaching the 1st temporary_goal
        set it as a new_start
    find next_greatest_deviation from new_start-goal # in this case, the next greatest_deviation is [11,5]
        set the latest greatest deviation as a temporary_goal
    after reaching the 1st temporary_goal
        set it as a new_start
    loop it until it reach the set original Goal [13,4.2]

    Given an original path (list/array of (x,y) points), this function splits the path
    into segments by detecting the point with the greatest perpendicular deviation from
    the straight line connecting the current start to the global goal.
    
    It then returns a simplified predictive path consisting of:
      - The starting point (from the ArUco)
      - Temporary goals corresponding to the greatest deviation points
      - The final goal
    
    Parameters:
        original_path: array-like shape (N, 2) of points
        deviation_threshold: minimum deviation (perpendicular distance) required to create a temporary goal
